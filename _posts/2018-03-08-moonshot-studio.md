<h4>About</h4>

Moonshot Studio is a team of creative developers that produces premier, responsive & interative web applications guaranteed to revolutionize any business.

At Moonshot Studio, we hold one goal above all others: 100% client satisfaction. Our in-house team of web designers and developers uphold the highest standards for project planning and execution, and weâ€™re dedicated to building the perfect website for your company on-time and on budget.

<h4>History</h4>

My old friend [**Shikami**](https://github.com/willardshikami) and I have shared interests since randomly stumbling into the same coding 101 cohort at the infamous [**Moringa School**](https://moringaschool.com). Aside from participating in sessions of _'serious conversations about anime'_, we also happen to subscribe to the web-developer lifestyle and so as it's bound to happen in such senarios we found ourselves gravitated towards collaborating on some project.

Moonshot Studios isn't just me & Shikami playing buddy buddy, we are fortunate to also have other partners with whom we are building amazing products and growing in bounds.

<h4>Approach towards work</h4>

We are always looking for interesting projects that we can get involved in. Before we pick up a challenge, we dissect it _like mad scientists_ to figure out the best attack angle. Once we are convinced it is something we can solve, the normal process begins:

<ul>

<li> Allocate time &amp; manpower to work on the project research.</li>

<li> Design an all ecompassing project proposal / outline for the client. It is vital to have every single detail down in writing in the scope. <i>( We don't want conflicts with our clients changing the rules down the road when the game is already a foot.)</i> </li>

<li> Set up a meeting to flag off the project once terms are agreed upon.

<li> Contact our financial partners with proforma invoice, they will henceforth deal with all the payment follow ups from this point including the after-service / mantainance fees.

<li> The sleepless nights &amp; zombie mornings of development begin. We crank up the pressure and the heat produces the all so amazing results we are known for. </li>

<li> When the project is due, we toast with our clients and then take some time off to cool down before jumping into the kitchen all over again.</li>

</ul>

<h4>What have we learnt so far?</h4>

<ul>

<li> Working with people you can get along with make even the most difficult of challenges seem a load lighter. We don't always agree on everything but our team is made up of friends so in the end it always works itself out.</li>

<li> Outsourcing specific tasks to those who are more experienced &amp; better equiped to deal effectively with the said task is always the best option. DIY can only take you so far and with looming deadlines, getting it down properly the first time is not only a cheaper route in the long run but we've gotten to build such amazing relationship with our clients by delivering on time. </li>

<li>Working on projects that we have never tackled before has produced some of the most frustrating but also some of the most fullfilling moments in our lives. While balancing out familiar tasks is key to keep the resources flowing, experiments build stronger, resilient &amp; more exprienced team members. </li>

<li> Comfortable and well balanced work-personal lifestyles for team members is more important than chasing the big bucks. Money isn't everything, itsn't even enough. </li>

<li> A good reputation does a company more good than over the top marketing strategies. Whenever in a fix, we work extra hard &amp; sometimes make personal sacrifices to ensure that our clients will come back with even more business for us. </li>

</ul>
